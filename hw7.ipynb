These embeddings are created by training a model like Word2Vec on a huge corpus of text such as a dump of Wikipedia or a dump of the web crawl. \n",

    "1. CountVectorizer is a technique that converts text documents into a matrix of word counts, treating each word as a separate feature. It focuses on word frequencies and ignores word order. The average-embedding approach, on the other hand, represents text by averaging the word embeddings of individual words, capturing semantic relationships and contextual information. It considers the meaning and context of words rather than just their frequencies.\n",
    "2. The CountVectorizer representation tends to be more interpretable compared to the average-embedding representation. This is because it directly captures the occurrence and frequency of individual words in the text, allowing for a straightforward understanding of which words are present and how often they appear. This representation can be easily interpreted by examining the feature weights or coefficients associated with each word, providing insights into the importance of specific words in the classification task.\n",
    "3. Yes, the use of pre-trained word embeddings such as en_core_web_md in the average-embedding approach involves transfer learning.The benefits of transfer learning in this context are that the pre-trained word embeddings provide a rich representation of word meanings and contextual relationships. This helps capture the semantic nuances of the text, even with limited training data. "

    "\n",
    "In this exercise you'll prepare the data for topic modeling using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/). Preprocessing is a crucial step before training an LDA model and it markedly affects topic modeling results. So let's carry out preprocessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Write code to carry out preprocessing of the \"text\" column in the dataframe above and store the preprocessed text in a new column called \"text_pp\" in the dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is no such thing as \"perfect\" preprocessing. You'll have to make your own judgments and decisions on which tokens are more informative and which ones are less informative for the given task. Some common text preprocessing steps for topic modeling are: \n",
    "- getting rid of slashes or other weird characters\n",
    "- sentence segmentation and tokenization      \n",
    "- getting rid of urls and email addresses\n",
    "- getting rid of other fairly unique tokens which are not going to help us in topic modeling  \n",
    "- excluding stopwords and punctuation \n",
    "- lemmatization        \n",
    "\n",
    "You might have to go back and forth between the preprocessing and topic modeling and interpretation steps in the next exercises. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Check out [these available attributes](https://spacy.io/api/token#attributes) for `token` in spaCy which might help you with preprocessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "> You can also get rid of words with specific POS tags. [Here](https://spacy.io/api/annotation/#pos-en) is the list of part-of-speech tags used in spaCy. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that preprocessing the corpus might take some time. So here are a couple of suggestions: 1) During the debugging phase, work on a smaller subset of the data. 2) Once you're done with the preprocessing part, you might want to save the preprocessed data so that you don't run the preprocessing part every time you run the notebook. \n"

    "- Decision Tree: It handles multiclass classification naturally. The algorithm splits the feature space into regions based on the class labels and creates decision rules to assign class labels to new instances. It can handle both binary and multiclass classification problems without any specific modifications.\n",

    "- KNN: It handles multiclass classification by using the \"one-vs-one\" or \"one-vs-all\" strategies. In the \"one-vs-one\" strategy, separate binary classifiers are trained for each pair of classes, and majority voting is used for prediction. In the \"one-vs-all\" strategy, a separate binary classifier is trained for each class against all the other classes, and the class with the highest probability is predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random Forest: It also handles multiclass classification naturally. The algorithm combines multiple decision trees and uses either the \"one-vs-one\" or \"one-vs-all\" strategies internally to handle multiclass problems. Each decision tree in the Random Forest independently predicts the class label, and the final prediction is made based on majority voting among the trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic Regression: This handles multiclass classification using the \"one-vs-rest\" strategy. In the \"one-vs-rest\" strategy, a separate binary logistic regression model is trained for each class against all the other classes. Each model predicts the probability of belonging to its respective class, and the class with the highest probability is predicted.\n",

    "- SVM RBF: This uses the \"one-vs-one\" strategy. Separate binary SVM models are trained for each pair of classes, and majority voting is used for prediction. The RBF kernel allows SVMs to handle non-linear decision boundaries, which can be effective for complex multiclass classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Transfer learning refers to utilizing pre-trained models trained on large datasets to extract useful features or representations. These models capture contextual information and visual patterns, respectively. By leveraging these pre-trained models, new tasks benefit from the learned representations even with limited task-specific data. The pre-trained models can be fine-tuned on smaller datasets to adapt to the specific task, improving performance. Transfer learning saves time and computational resources, addresses data scarcity, and enables faster convergence. However, the effectiveness depends on the similarity between the pre-training and target tasks/domains. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. It allows for the reuse and modification of different parts of the network. In transfer learning, the pre-trained layers of a neural network, known as the \"base network,\" capture general features and patterns from a large-scale dataset. By treating the pre-trained layers as a fixed feature extractor and appending new layers for the specific target task, only the new layers need to be trained on the task-specific data. This approach enables the transfer of knowledge from the pre-trained layers to the new layers, resulting in improved performance with limited labeled data. The sequential nature of neural networks facilitates this modular transfer and adaptation of learned representations, making transfer learning effective and efficient."
